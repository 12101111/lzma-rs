# lzma-rs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gendx/lzma-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gendx/lzma-rs)

This project is an LZMA decoder written in pure Rust, with focus on clarity.

## Encoder

For now, there is also a dumb encoder that only uses byte literals, with many hard-coded constants for code simplicity.

## Contributing

Pull-requests are welcome, to improve the decoder, add better encoders, or more tests.
Ultimately, this project should also implement LZMA2, as well as .xz and .7z files.
